## MITx-6.86x-ML-Projects
#### Project 1:
- Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.
- Use your classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.
- Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.

#### Project 2:
- linear regression
- support vector machine
- multinomial regression
- principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction
- polynomial and Gaussian RBF kernels
